# Hierarchical-Clustering

Two types 
         
         1. Agglomerative
         
         2. Divisive
         
We use Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering Technique(i.e Bottom Up Approach)  

Steps :  

      ---> Make each data point a single-point cluster.That forms N-Clusters.
      
      ---> Take the two closest data points and make them one cluster.That form N-1.
      
      ---> Take the two closest clusters and make them one cluster.That forms N-2 Clusters.
      
      ---> Repeat above step until there is only one cluster.
      
      ---> Finally, all the clusters are merged together and form a single cluster.
      
      
* The Hierarchical clustering Technique can be visualized using a Dendrogram.  

# Dendograms - Optimal Solution
        
       ---> By crossing the largest distance vertical line in dendogarm we will get the optimal number of clusters.
